**Evolutionary transitions from outcrossing to selfing**

 The transition  from outcrossing to selfing is very common in flowering plants and has  important demographic, genetic and evolutionary consequences. We have  worked on this problem using two main systems (_Turnera_, _Eichhornia_); both involve the evolutionary breakdown of heterostyly ([58](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#58), [72](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#72)). Most of our focus in recent years has been on the neotropical, annual, aquatic _Eichhornia paniculata_, where we have evidence of multiple independent transitions to selfing ([115](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#115), [259](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#259)).  This species is an excellent study system as it is diploid, easily  crossed and we can grow 2-3 generations a year in our glasshouses at  Toronto. We have extensive collections of _E. paniculata_ from throughout its range ( Brazil, Jamaica, Cuba, Central America). Work by [Brian Husband](http://www.uoguelph.ca/ib/people/faculty/husband.shtml), Martin Morgan and [Josh Kohn](http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/faculty/kohn.html)  in the 90s demonstrated that the shift to selfing in _E. paniculata_  results from the joint action of genetic drift and natural selection  and represents one of the few cases that meet several of the key  conditions in Sewall’s Wright’s shifting balance theory of evolution ([97](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#97), [100](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#100), [102](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#102), [124](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#124)). 

Current work is focused on the molecular population genetic and genomic consequences of transitions to selfing in _E. paniculata_ ([242](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#242), [263](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#263)). During his Ph.D., [Rob Ness](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/Ness.html) in collaboration with PDF [Mathieu Siol](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/MSiol.html) developed extensive genomic resources for this species, including _de novo_  assemblies of the floral transcriptomes of outcrossing and selfing  genotypes. This was conducted using short read sequences from the  Illumina Solexa GA II available in our department at [CAGEF](http://www.cagef.utoronto.ca/)  . These resources have provided us with \~10,000 single copy EST’s. We  have also identified 269 genes associated with floral development, 22 of  which are differentially expressed in selfing lineages. These represent  a set of potential candidate genes for investigating the evolution of  the selfing syndrome. 

I would like to  recruit a PDF and a Ph.D. student to continue with this project to  investigate the genetic architecture of the selfing syndrome by  identifying genomic regions responsible for traits governing the  transition to selfing, as well as identifying the genes governing  tristyly. Also, by looking at genome-wide polymorphism data it will be  possible to investigate the reduced efficacy of selection that should  occur in selfing populations as a result of their lower effective  population sizes. Our recent review of the population genomics of plant  adaptation ([266](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#266))  illustrates that there is considerable scope for investigating a range  of questions in molecular population genomics and evolution concerning  how selection can shape genomes in plant populations. _Eichhornia paniculata_ provides a valuable system for addressing many of these questions in the context of mating-system variation.

>      Floral and mating system diversity in _Eichhornia_ (Pontederiaceae) species ([143](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#143)). _Eichhornia paniculata_   – A) a population in a Cuban rice field; B) inflorescence; C)  outcrossing and selfing flowers from Brazil and Jamaica, respectively.  Style morph frequencies in natural populations indicate the breakdown  pathway to selfing from the 1:1:1 equilibrium in trimorphic populations.  This results from the joint interaction of genetic drift and natural  selection. The pathway involves three stages with sequential loss of  morphs from trimorphism to dimorphism and finally to monomorphism ([72](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#72), [259](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#259)).
