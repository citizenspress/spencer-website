I have a long-standing interest in gender  strategies, and in trying to understand the costs and benefits of  combined versus separate sexes. Earlier work involved studies of _Aralia_ ([16](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#16), [18](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#18)) and _Wurmbea_ ([179](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#179), [227](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#227)) but more recently we have concentrated our efforts on the clonal, aquatic plant genus _Sagittaria_, particularly _S. latifolia_.  This species is common in eastern N. America and populations are mostly  either monoecious or dioecious and occupy different wetland habitats.  Although plants of the two sexual systems are fully inter-fertile, there  is little gene flow between them over most of their range because of  ecological and life-history differentiation. We have exploited the  intra-specific variation in sexual systems of _S. latifolia_ in an effort to understand the ecological and genetic mechanisms responsible for the evolution and maintenance of dioecy ([177](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#177), [184](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#184), [198](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#198), [205](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/BarrettLab/schb_pub.html#205), [216](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/BarrettLab/schb_pub.html#216)). [Sarah Yakimowski](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/Yakimowski.html) has recently developed microsatellite markers for this species ([257](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#257))  and this has allowed us to investigate the breakdown of sexual system  differentiation at range limits where populations are composed of  females, males and hermaphrodites ([267](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#267)).

> Floral diversity in insect-pollinated _Wurmbea_ (Colchicaeae) species ([227](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#227)). Populations of these species are either monomorphic or dimorphic for gender ([243](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#243)).

I would be interested in supervising future student projects on _Sagittaria_  and these could involve investigations of: 1) the genetic basis of life  history differentiation in monoecious and dioecious populations using  QTL-mapping, 2) the ecological mechanisms responsible for sexual system  differentiation through reciprocal transplant experiments; 3) the role  of clone size, geitonogamous selfing and inbreeding depression in the  spread of unisexuals in monoecious populations.

We have also been working on the problem of sex ratio bias in dioecious populations. [David Field](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/Field.html) and [Melinda Pickup](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/M_Pickup.html),  two PDF’s currently in the lab, are preparing a review paper concerning  the ecological and life history correlates of biased sex ratios in  dioecious species. In addition, we have been working on _Rumex_  species, a group of wind-pollinated herbs characterized by female biased  sex ratios. 

We are interested in determining the mechanisms responsible  for this female bias, which is less common in flowering plants than  male bias. Working with _R. nivalis,_ former PDF [Ivana Stehlik](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/Istehlik.html) demonstrated that bias results from both microgametophyte selection and gender based differences in mortality ([223](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#223), [226](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#226), [233](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#233), [249](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#249)).  

This work was greatly facilitated by the development of sex–specific  markers. We are now exploring sexual dimorphism and the mechanisms  governing female bias in _R. hastatulus_, an annual species  native to the southern USA ranging in distribution from Texas to North  Carolina. Specifically, Melinda Pickup is investigating three main  questions: 

1. What is the extent of geographical variation in sexual  dimorphism; 

2. to what extent does the local mating environment  influence the degree of female bias in progeny sex ratios; 

3. what is  the relative importance of plant density and local sex ratio variation  on progeny sex ratios.

I am interested in recruiting a Ph.D. student and a PDF to begin collaboration with my colleague [Stephen Wright](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/wright/Stephen_I._Wright/Welcome.html)  in EEB on sex chromosome evolution in _R. hastatulus_.  This species is an excellent model system because it is annual, very  easy to grow and cross, and we also have a broad sampling of  geographical variation.

The species is of particular interest because it  possesses two distinct mechanisms of sex determination. In populations  from the western portion of the range females are XX and males are XY,  whereas in eastern populations females are XX and males are XYY.  Phylogenetic evidence indicates that species in the genus with two  Y-chromosomes are derived from those with a single Y.

We are interested  in investigating various aspects of the molecular population genetics  and molecular evolution of X- and Y-chromosomes in this group. This will  be achieved by obtaining sex-linked markers using genomic approaches  and high throughput sequencing. Specifically, we will investigate the  hypothesis of Y-chromosome degeneration and reduced effective population  size of the Y-chromosome resulting from suppression of recombination  and the fixation of deleterious mutations.

This will be undertaken by  comparing patterns and amounts of nucleotide diversity and molecular  evolution across regions of the X and Y chromosome, and with autosomal  genes. We are also interested in investigating the relation between  sex-linked genes and the degree of sexual dimorphism, and the extent to  which female bias in populations may influence patterns of diversity.  Finally, obtaining a suite of sex-linked markers will also provide an  outstanding resource for future experimental studies aimed at dissecting  the gender-based life-cycle selection that results in female bias.
