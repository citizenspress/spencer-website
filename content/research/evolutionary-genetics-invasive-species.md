Ever since I worked as a weed biologist in Swaziland and the Lower  Amazon Basin, I have been fascinated by the ecology and evolution of  invasive plants. Where do they come from and why are they invasive? My  early studies concerned two quite different problems: 1) crop mimicry in  barnyard grasses ([24](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#24)); 2) the relative importance of clonal vs. sexual reproduction in water hyacinth ([10](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#10), [11](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#11)). 

More recently, in collaboration with my former Ph.D. students [Chris Eckert](http://post.queensu.ca/\~eckertc/Eckert_Lab/Welcome.html) (Queens University) and [Rob Colautti](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/Colautti.html)  (now a PDF with Tom Mitchell-Olds at Duke) we have been investigating  the evolution of local adaptation in the wetland invader Lythrum  salicaria. 

By sampling seed collected from representative populations  across the invasive eastern North American range and using common garden  and quantitative genetic analyses we have demonstrated: 

1. abundant  heritable variation for most life history traits; 

2. reduced variance  and increased skew of quantitative traits with northward migration; 

3. strong clines in flowering time and plant size associated with latitude  and length of growing season; and 

4. evidence for genetic constraints at  range limits between flowering time and size ([265](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#265)).   

Further, reciprocal transplant experiments and measurements of natural  selection have provided evidence indicating a fitness advantage to  plants that flower earlier at a smaller size in northern populations ([271](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#271)).  

There are still many fascinating questions concerning the invasion  genetics of purple loosestrife and I would be interested in  collaborating with a student on this system.

In addition, I have  recently completed a collaborative study with colleagues in China from Beijing Normal University on a world wide survey of genetic diversity in  water hyacinth ([268](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#268)).  This study highlights the need for more intensive surveys of  populations in the native range and for studies of genotype by  environment interactions to investigate the ecological tolerances of  clones from different regions. 

> Invasive species with diverse reproductive systems investigated in the Barrett Lab; clonal water hyacinth (_Eichhornia crassipes_, Pontederiaceae) in its native (1a, Argentina) and introduced (1b, Vietnam) range, see [21](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#21), [268](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#268); the wind-pollinated, annual, common ragweed (2a,b _Ambrosia artemisiifolia_, Asteraceae) native to eastern North America ([246](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#246)); 3, the perennial, distylous, ruderal _Turnera subulata_ (Turneraceae), native to Brazil and introduced to S.E. Asia ([5](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#5)); 4, purple loosestrife (_Lythrum salicara_, Lythraceae), a tristylous wetland invader native to Eurasia and common in wetlands of eastern N. America ([139](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#139), [237](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#237), [264](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#264), [265](http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/schb_pub.html#265)).
