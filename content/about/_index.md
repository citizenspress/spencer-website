- Evolution and genetics of invasive species

## Barrett's Lab Research

The research in my laboratory focuses on understanding the mechanisms responsible for the evolution of plant mating strategies and their genetic and evolutionary consequences. We also work on the genetics of invasive species, the role of local adaptation in colonization, and plant barcoding and its applications. Our studies involve diverse groups, with a major focus on _Eichhornia_, _Lythrum_, _Rumex_ and _Sagittaria_. 

Our work integrates different approaches including theory, comparative biology, field experiments, genomics, and quantitative, ecological and evolutionary genetics. Research projects are currently being conducted in Argentina, Chile, China, New Zealand, South Africa and North America.
