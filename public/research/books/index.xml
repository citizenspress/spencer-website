      <description>Major Evolutionary Transitions in Flowering Plant Reproduction Special Issue - International Journal of Plant Sciences (2008)
Edited by:S.C.H. Barrett (2008)
Chapman &amp;amp; Hall, New York.
Among plant life-history traits, those that constitute the reproductive system are the most influential in governing macroevolutionary patterns and microevolutionary processes. This fundamental role arises because reproductive mechanisms influence genetic transmission, population genetic structure, selection response and patterns of evolutionary diversification. Flowering plants exhibit striking diversity in reproductive traits with closely related species often possessing different pollination and mating systems.</description>

      <description>Ecology and Evolution of Flowers (2006) Editors:
Lawrence D. Harder, University of Calgary
Spencer C. H. Barrett, University of Toronto
Publisher: Oxford University Press, Alpinia (Zingiberaceae)
The reproductive organs and mating biology of angiosperms exhibit greater variety than those of any other group of organisms. Flowers and inflorescences are also the most diverse structures produced by angiosperms, and floral traits provide some of the most compelling examples of evolution by natural selection.</description>

      <title>Floral Biology -- on Floral Evolution in Animal-Pollinated Plants</title>

      <description>Floral Biology: Studies on Floral Evolution in Animal-Pollinated Plants Editors:
D.G. Lloyd
S.C.H. Barrett
Publisher:
Chapman &amp;amp; Hall, New York.
Studies in floral biology are largely concerned with how flowers function to promote pollination and mating. The role of pollination in governing mating patterns in plant populations inextricably links the evolution of pollination and mating systems. Despite the close functional link between pollination and mating, research conducted for most of this century on these two fundamental aspects of plant reproduction has taken quite separate courses.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Function of Heterostyly</title>

      <description>Evolution and Function of Heterostyly (1992) Editors:
Spencer C. H. Barrett
Publisher:
Springer-Verlag, Berlin.
A century of research on heterostylous plants has passed since the publication of Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s book &amp;ldquo;The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species&amp;rdquo; in 1877 summarizing his extensive observations and experiments on these complex breeding systems involving genetic polymorphisms of floral sex organs. Since then heterostylous plants have provided a rich source of material for evolutionary biologists and today they represent one of the classic research paradigms for approaches to the study of evolution and adaptation.</description>
